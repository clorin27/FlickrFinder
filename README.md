Bleacher Report Coding Challenge

### Notes
I really enjoyed this coding challenge.  While building the app, I wanted to write efficient code that could be built upon were the app to continue expanding.  I focused on implementing a powerful networking layer and a clean view model so that the view controllers could remain as simple as possible.  In doing so, I ensured the reusability of the code while also making it easy to read and understand if other developers were to work on my project.

If I could spend more time on FlickFindr, I would expand on the UI elements and their corresponding functionality in order to make the app more user friendly.  I would add loading indicators, icons, and provide a color theme.  I could also further flesh out how pictures are presented by paginating, presenting suggested categories or recent searches, provide more functionality(like animation) to my splash screen, or allowing users to bookmark or favorite pictures.
